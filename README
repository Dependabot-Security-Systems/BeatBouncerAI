# BeatBouncer AI

## The Problem

With the recent acceleration in AI-driven musical creation, in which generation has been conducted to replicate styles of particular artists, dead or alive, one thing is clear:

*Human-made musical artistry is at risk*

This comes with a significant series of potential issues:
- Artist revenue drops even further than it already has with the advent of streaming sites like spotify.
- Artist reach drops.
- Access to the already-saturated industry of musicianship becomes even harder to access.
- Potential new creators and innovators are deterred from the industry.
- Life-long industry workers careers are at risk - this expands beyond just the artists themselves.
- Algorithm-driven creations, based on what is likely to be most popular stunts innovation and creativity... in an industry that solely relies on its innovation and creativity.

## Purpose

The purpose of BeatBouncer AI is to protect human-made musical works and musicians. It does this by determining two things:

1. If the musical work likely created by another AI.
2. If the musical work closely resembles the work of a human musical artists.

It will be metric-driven, using contiuous learning to become more accurate over time, to become useful for potential legal safeguarding of artists over the entire industry.
